Spacegraph nodes connect / disconnect / translate 

Draw edges for one way and unexplored regions

Notegrid draw tile by tile

Extra Notegrids and unbound Space nodes connecting them

Inventory implement additional behaviour. focus_exited?

LineEdit text capture



Projects

Minimal tree based todo list with history. Some overlap with Heimer but with 
more rigid (cleaner) layout and controls 
and a way to hide information in nodes
and a history to keep track of what has been done
and connections to subtrees.
