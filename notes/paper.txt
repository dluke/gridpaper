Todo

Use light2d to illuminate notegrid
Notegrid draw tile by tile

Editable descriptions and notes


Spacegraph nodes connect / disconnect / translate 

Draw edges for one way and unexplored regions


Extra Notegrids and unbound Space nodes connecting them

Inventory implement additional behaviour. focus_exited? 

Notes

for small (i.e. 16x16 pixels) icons. Should try to obtain pixel perfect icon.
Conversion from small Svg to texture will be fuzzy.


What if I learn GPU programming and use it to help out the group.

Godot Issue Tracer (?)



changing the class_name of a node and introducting a new unique node using the original node class_name doesn't update properly until class_name command is removed from the old node. The Type: X mouse over hint on nodes in the 
SceneTree does not give the actual type but (parent?) (Godot Engine type?)

Some hard to pin down issues with setting properties in the Editor 
with resaving/renaming resources 


Godot "file open" Editor for selecting script for node does not allow searching
and does not allow "open" (finish) even after typing a valid filename (must 
select with mouse) 



Projects

Minimal tree based todo list with history. Some overlap with Heimer but with 
more rigid (cleaner) layout and controls 
and a way to hide information in nodes
and a history to keep track of what has been done
and connections to subtrees.
